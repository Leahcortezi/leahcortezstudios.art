# Design Work Case Study Conversion Guide

## üéØ Updated Image Paths for Design Projects

All design work now uses local `images/` folder structure instead of the global images directory.

### Standard Path Format:
```html
<!-- Hero Section -->
<img src="images/[filename].jpg" alt="Project Name" loading="lazy">

<!-- Solution Section -->  
<img src="images/[filename].jpg" alt="Final Design" loading="lazy">

<!-- Meta Tags -->
<meta property="og:image" content="images/[filename].jpg">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="images/[filename].jpg">
```
