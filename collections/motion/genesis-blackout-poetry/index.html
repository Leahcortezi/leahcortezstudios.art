                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>This kinetic typography animation emerges from a blackout poem that reinterprets the Genesis narrative through Eve's emotional perspective. Rather than perpetuating the traditional master narrative that positions her as the source of original sin and wrongdoing, this piece humanizes Eve—foregrounding her fear, desire, shame, and the weight of being judged for wanting knowledge and agency.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using fragmented phrases like "she saw," "they knew," "I was afraid," and "I hid," the animation constructs a counter-narrative that centers vulnerability and selfhood. It asks: what does the story look like when told from Eve's point of view? How do dominant religious and cultural narratives erase nuance, humanity, and the interior lives of those they condemn?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                    <p>Each frame of the animation was meticulously designed in Adobe Illustrator, allowing for precise control over typography, composition, and visual hierarchy. Once individual frames were refined, they were brought into Adobe After Effects where timing, transitions, and motion were orchestrated to create a cohesive animated sequence.</p>
                    
                    <p>The animation employs controlled pacing and organic typographic transitions to mirror the emotional rhythm of the reimagined narrative. Text appears, lingers, and dissolves in time with the unfolding of Eve's internal experience—balancing readability with expressive timing. Typography shifts in weight, scale, and movement to guide the viewer through moments of revelation, fear, and introspection.</p>
                    
                    <p>A central visual motif—the growth of a "Genesis tree"—serves as both literal and symbolic anchor. The tree emerges gradually throughout the sequence, representing transformation, knowledge, consequence, and the organic unfolding of a story that refuses to be contained by a single interpretation. Its growth parallels Eve's emotional journey, rooting the abstract text in a tangible, evolving form.</p>
                    
                    <p>Faculty feedback informed refinements to pacing and legibility, ensuring that the piece balances poetic abstraction with narrative clarity. The result is a motion piece that invites close attention—rewarding viewers who sit with the rhythm of the words and consider their implications.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>This project demonstrates how motion design can be a tool for narrative disruption and reinterpretation. By transforming a blackout poem into animated form, the piece gives voice to a figure historically silenced and blamed. It challenges viewers to reconsider familiar stories, question whose perspective is centered in traditional narratives, and recognize the humanity within those who have been flattened into archetypes of moral failure.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>Genesis: Reframing Eve</em> is both a technical exercise in kinetic typography and a conceptual exploration of counter-narrative—showing how design can amplify marginalized voices and invite critical engagement with dominant cultural texts.</p>
