                    <h2>About The Piece</h2>
                    <p>This album cover design was created as part of a reductive photo solutions project inspired by the visual legacy of the Blue Note jazz label. Tasked with designing a vinyl LP cover using historical photography from the Library of Congress, I selected a performance image of swing-era trumpeter Buck Clayton and reimagined it through the lens of visual rhythm, emotional tone, and graphic abstraction.</p>
                    <p>The goal was not just to reflect the music visually, but to embody the feeling of <em>Swingin’ Dream</em>—a title that conjures both elegance and motion. I approached the piece by reducing the photographic content to its most expressive elements, applying a coarse halftone texture and isolating the silhouette of Clayton mid-performance. His posture and trumpet gesture act as visual anchors, leading the viewer’s eye rhythmically from left to right, mimicking the phrasing of a melodic line.</p>
                    <p>To complement the imagery, I used soft lavender stripes arranged with intentional asymmetry to evoke the steady yet flowing quality of jazz swing. The color palette and type choices follow the mechanical, restrained ethos of Blue Note designs, using slab serif and sans-serif typography in a clean, structured format that still allows for expressive movement. The result is a visual composition that feels both historically grounded and emotionally resonant—capturing not just the structure of a jazz performance, but its atmospheric mood, improvisational energy, and subtle complexity.</p>
                    <p>This piece is a study in balance—between reduction and expressiveness, between geometry and gesture, between photographic archive and contemporary design interpretation.</p>
