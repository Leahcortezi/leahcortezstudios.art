                    <h2>Concept</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project reimagines the identity of City Reliquary by emphasizing the museum's distinctive method of storytelling—history told not through a single narrative, but through a collage of objects. Unlike traditional institutions that center grand historical events, City Reliquary preserves everyday artifacts, assembling fragments of urban life into a layered cultural archive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal was to translate this curatorial approach into a symbol-based logo that reflects accumulation, preservation, and the visual language of collected ephemera.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        The identity centers on a symbolic mark constructed through layered forms, referencing the museum's collage methodology. Rather than relying solely on typography, the logo distills the idea of artifact assemblage into a unified emblem—multiple visual elements working together to create a cohesive whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Structured geometry and contained composition evoke cataloging systems and display vitrines, reinforcing themes of preservation and institutional credibility. The forms visually overlap and interlock, suggesting how individual objects—each with its own story—combine to construct a broader narrative of the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The typography is restrained and supportive, allowing the symbol to function as the primary identifier while maintaining clarity across applications such as signage, exhibition materials, and digital platforms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Result</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final identity system reflects City Reliquary's curatorial philosophy: history as a mosaic of fragments. By transforming the concept of collage into a structured symbolic mark, the logo communicates both preservation and plurality. The system balances archival sensibility with contemporary clarity, positioning the museum as a guardian of everyday cultural memory.
                    </p>
