                    <h2>About The Piece</h2>
                    <p>“Artificial Meadow” began as a drawing assignment that challenged me to create a landscape from an arrangement of everyday household objects. I used a scarf, crystals, cover-up fabric, and paper to build a small physical scene—then reimagined it through drawing as a surreal dreamscape that blurs the line between the synthetic and the natural.</p>
                    <p>Colored pencil was my medium of choice to amplify texture and push the colors into vivid, unnatural territory. The blades of grass twist like ribbons, growing from fabric folds and patterned surfaces. What once were simple materials now pulse with movement, layered into an uncanny terrain that feels both familiar and strange.</p>
                    <p>The sky was a key focus—I wanted it to evoke a surreal galaxy, with swirling forms and radiant colors that suggest a cosmic backdrop. The sun, in contrast, glows with an almost artificial intensity, casting a surreal brightness across the scene. Together, they create an atmosphere that feels suspended between reality and imagination.</p>
                    <p>This piece plays with perception—taking overlooked, ordinary objects and transforming them into something magical. Artificial Meadow invites the viewer to consider how wonder can emerge from the mundane, and how a shift in perspective can reveal beauty in unexpected places.</p>
                    <p>Through this process, I also discovered that creating your own references is an art form in itself—a way to design your own world from scratch, where the act of building the source is just as meaningful as rendering it.</p>
