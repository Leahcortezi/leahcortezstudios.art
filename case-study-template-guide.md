## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Choose your strongest project** (recommend Entre Mundos)
2. **Gather all existing materials** - images, sketches, notes
3. **Write content using this template** - focus on story and process
4. **Create placeholder areas** for missing visuals
5. **Test the layout** - make sure it reads well
6. **Get feedback** from peers or mentors
7. **Iterate and refine** based on feedback

Remember: Case studies show how you think, not just what you create. Focus on your decision-making process and cultural perspective - that's what makes you unique as a designer.
