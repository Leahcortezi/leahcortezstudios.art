# Community Page Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Image Upload Form Submission
**Problem**: Form was showing both success and error messages, causing confusion.
**Solution**: 
- Simplified form submission handling to prevent conflicting messages
- Form now shows immediate success feedback and lets FormSubmit handle the actual submission
- Removed async fetch that was interfering with FormSubmit's redirect

### 2. Email to Instagram Handle Conversion
**Problem**: Form required email addresses, which aren't as useful for showcasing artists.
**Solution**:
- Changed email field to Instagram handle field
- Added validation for Instagram handle format (@username)
- Updated API to store `artist_instagram` instead of `artist_email`
- Updated admin approval form to use Instagram handles

### 3. Clickable Instagram Links in Showcase
**Problem**: Artist names were displayed as plain text in the showcase.
**Solution**:
- Converted artist display from "by Artist Name" to clickable Instagram handles
- Added Instagram icon on hover for better UX
- All Instagram handles now link directly to Instagram profiles
- Updated both placeholder artworks and dynamic content to use Instagram links
